<p>Title: <em>Safe, Cheap, and Smart: Collaborative Robots in Manufacturing</em></p>

<p>**Abstract: **Rethink Robotics is one of the pioneers of the recent trend of “Collaborative Robots” in manufacturing automation - robots that work alongside human workers (as opposed to traditional industrial robots that are caged and separated). Collaborative robots tend to be safe, cheap and smart, in contrast to current industrial automation, which is dangerous, expensive and generally shipped without built-in intelligence. This combination of properties is enabling automation in areas that are currently not automated by traditional approaches.
This talk will discuss the business opportunity in this space, and describe some of the technologies used by Rethink to create collaborative robots. It will provide insight into some of the practical challenges with bringing a new and complex electromechanical product to market, including approaches to creating low cost technology, and ways to balance research, advanced development and productization efforts over the course of a product lifecycle, within a startup environment.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Factory Automation and it’s role in IoT</em></p>

<p>**Abstract: **With the ever increasing complexity of product design, electronics manufacturing service sector and supply chain industry will be faced with more pressure to ensure advanced manufacturing techniques are utilized that result in equal or better quality and reliability of product. In addition, with rising labor cost in China and the localization and regionalization of products, automation is becoming increasingly favorable in western countries. However, automation by itself is not adequate. Some challenges that highly developed countries will face is the justification of automation relevant to labor cost and derived benefits. Hence, low cost automation including all low-cost Robots and SMART automation methodologies will be needed to realize the full potential of automation. Data from automated process linking to a company’s big-data platform to be able to do analytics is equally important. Internet of Things (Iot) as it is related to manufacturing process will give rise to more and more uses of sensors both at product and factory level. Collecting discrete and batch data will suddenly make analytics at product level more interesting and will provide meaningful insights into attributes that are not commonly known. Automation will be the way IoT will become a tool beyond theories. Automation will give IoT it’s place on factory floors, in logistics center, in supply chain lanes and many more dependencies never known in the past.
Flextronics is pioneering in this space and has demonstrated the creation of such a system that will be demonstrated in the forum. Flextronics vision is to work with its customers, supply chain, consortiums, academia and partners to take the lead and setup IoT ready manufacturing cells which become the central icon to both disseminating the right information but also fast and real-time to enable pull from the point of use, allowing velocity, variability, veracity and visualization like never before.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Mo’ robots, mo’ problems. Experiences transitioning from academia to industry</em></p>

<p>**Abstract: **In academic research and early product development it is common to spend months or even years understanding and perfecting a single system to achieve amazing results. However, in industry there comes a time when we engineers can’t be there to watch over and fix each of our individual creations. Mechanical, electrical, and software solutions that worked flawlessly in the laboratory inevitably fall prey to Murphy’s law in the field. Why is it so hard to replicate our successful systems? Manufacturing variations and wear are often overlooked in research settings, but they can critically affect system performance. In this workshop I will share with you some of my own experiences, challenges, and observations moving from academic research to building lots of real-world robots (sometimes with mixed, although always entertaining, results).</p>

<p>**Bio: **Joe Romano received his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania’s GRASP laboratory focusing on novel haptic device design and autonomous haptic sensing and manipulation strategies. Joe was part of the engineering team that brought Rethink Robotics Baxter Robot to life and now works as a Research Scientist developing next-generation platforms at Kiva Systems in North Reading, Massachusetts. Despite the challenges of building many robots, Joe still remains an undaunted optimist on the power of robots to solve all of our problems.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Technology and Design - Enhancing Surgical Performance</em></p>

<p>**Abstract: **Since the launch of the initial da Vinci System in 2000, Intuitive Surgical’s products have helped surgeons treat over 2 million patients. In my presentation, I will provide an overview of the context and history of da Vinci robotic surgery, and the fundamental needs and constraints of surgery that differ from other robotic applications. At its essence, the da Vinci system applies telerobotic technology to enhance human performance, both perception and manipulation. I will describe the key characteristics and technologies that have made the da Vinci system a successful product, some recent innovations, and the needs and opportunities for future advancements. I will talk from the perspective of a robotics engineer leading a user-centered design team within a product development organization. I will share some of the methodologies of user-centered design and its value for creating impactful products.</p>

<p>**Bio: **Paul Millman is Vice President of Product Development at Intuitive Surgical, Inc. where he leads a multi-disciplinary team focused on understanding and addressing user needs. Paul has been working in industry on the development of surgical robotic systems for the past 18 years. As a mechanical engineer and engineering manager at Computer Motion Inc. from 1996-2003, he helped develop the Zeus Robotic Surgical System. Since 2003 he has worked in various roles at Intuitive Surgical developing multiple generations of the da Vinci Surgical system, including the da Vinci Si Surgeon Console and the recently launched da Vinci Xi. His academic training includes an MS and PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University where he was a member of the Laboratory for Intelligent Mechanical Systems, and a Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Harvard Biorobotics Laboratory. His research focused on the design of telerobotic systems and haptic displays, as well as haptic perception.</p>

<p>Title: <em>Well..How Did I Get Here?</em></p>

<p>**Abstract: **
You never know where your expertise, experience, and Internet presence will take you. This talk will explain how I became involved with Oculus and virtual reality, while being a robotics professor on sabbatical. An important takeaway from this talk is that our robotics background may be useful in commercial endeavors that extend well outside of robotics. This is partly due to our comfort with problems and systems that extend across multiple disciplines, such as computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. This is a natural consequence of robots mixing sensing, actuation, and computation, which furthermore gives us useful exposure to the gaps between theory and practice.</p>

<p>**Bio: **
Steve LaValle started working with Oculus VR a few days after its successful Kickstarter campaign and led its R&amp;D efforts up to its $2 billion acquisition by Facebook in March 2014. He developed perceptually tuned head tracking methods based on IMUs and compute vision. He has also led a team of perceptual psychologists to provide principled approaches to virtual reality system calibration and the design of comfortable user experiences. He is also Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois. He has worked in robotics for over 20 years and is known for his introduction of the Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRTs) algorithm of motion planning and his book, Planning Algorithms.</p>
