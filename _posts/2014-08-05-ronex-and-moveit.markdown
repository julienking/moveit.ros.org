title: RoNex and MoveIt!
description: The Shadow Robot Company has released the RoNex series of products based on an industrial strength fieldbus. The RoNex modules come natively with ROS drivers allowing users to build and connect custom robot hardware directly to their computers. Check out the video below to see how MoveIt! was used to control a custom arm built with RoNex modules (the MoveIt! part is at the 2:00 minute mark).
